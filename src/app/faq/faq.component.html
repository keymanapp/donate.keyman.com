                When you donate to the Keyman project, we receive personal information from you. We use this data to acknowledge your donation, provide you with donation receipts, and correspond with you through newsletters or email. You can read more about what information we receive, the purposes we use that information for, and how we handle it in our <a href="https://www.keyman.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                We work hard to protect your information. We believe in, and practice, multi-layered security controls and practices, including both technical and organizational methods. We have agreements with third parties and have adopted other security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of the information under our control or under the control of our service providers. The vendors receiving your information are contractually obligated to handle the data in ways that are approved by SIL International. The vendors we use to send emails or other marketing materials to you aren’t permitted to use your information for their own direct marketing purposes. They also aren’t allowed to share your data with anyone else for direct marketing purposes. In addition, we will keep your personal data only for as long as we need it to provide you services, manage our business or as required by law or contract. You can find more information in the <a href="https://www.keyman.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Except as disclosed in our <a href="https://www.keyman.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>, we do not share any personal data unless you expressly agree that we may do so.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, when you donate to SIL International through a third party like <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy/">Stripe</a>, those organizations also collect your data. Their collection and use of your data is governed by their respective privacy policies.

            <div class="question">Why do you need my address in order to process a donation?</div>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                We understand that your privacy is very important. We ask for a minimum amount of information required to process credit/debit card donations, including billing addresses. This allows our payment processor to verify your identity, process your payment, and prevent fraudulent charges to your card. We keep your information private — if you have questions, please refer to our <a href="https://www.keyman.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. If you would rather not fill in your information on our online donation form, you can <a href="/ways-to-give#check">mail a check or money order</a>.

              <p>
                Resources for the work of SIL are provided primarily by individuals and organizations interested in SIL's work. In addition, for many of its larger projects, SIL seeks grants from a variety of other sources, both public and private. Less than one percent of its income is derived from any sort of government source.
